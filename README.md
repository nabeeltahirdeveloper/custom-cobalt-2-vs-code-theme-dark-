To work on the theme:

1. Clone this repo and open in VS Code

## Deploying a new version

These are mostly notes for me.

1. Increment the version number in `package.json`
1. run `npm run bundle`

## I don't like something

First, this theme is new so if something is funky, please open an issue. There are many languages and parts of VS Code I don't use, so let me know!

These are the things we have control over. If you would like to change something, you can either open a PR and see if I'd like it added, or override the colours in your own settings.json file.
